# odin-RockPaperScissors

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game written in Vanilla JavaScript as part of The Odin Project 
(https://www.theodinproject.com/)

The first portion of this project is written to be played entirely in the console

The second portion of this project involves implementing DOM and Event listeners so the game can be played entirely in the browser window. Also learn to create a branch and later merge it into the main repo.
